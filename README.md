---

## You need

- ESP32 development board.
- a DMX board or build your own using a chip like the MAX485. Inexpensive DMX shields (like [Keyestudio KS0529](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/KS0529_Keyestudio_DMX%EF%BC%88RDM%EF%BC%89Shield)) with XLR connectors already attached are the easiest option. There isnâ€™t one definitive guide to recommend, so please search the web to find more info relevant to your use case.
- connect ESP32 to DMX board `enable`, `RX` and `TX` pins. Defaults are `4`, `16`, `17`. Connect 3.3 or 5 V power to the DMX board.
- install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) to build and flash the project to your device.
- your own copy of [SparkWeaver Web](https://github.com/rzuppur/sparkweaver.web) or use the hosted version at [dmx.reinozuppur.com](https://dmx.reinozuppur.com/) to control the device remotely. Default bluetooth pairing password is 654321.
